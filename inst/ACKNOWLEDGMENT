First, I want to thank Rene Brun for his continuous help ever since I have
started to use ROOT in summer 1999, including checking my paper and demo source
code that I have presented at the DSC 2003 in Vienna.

I want also to thank all other ROOT developers who answered all my questions
during all these years, especially Fons Rademakers, Christian Holm Christensen,
Philippe Canal, Valeri Fine, Valeriy Onuchin, Damir Buskulic, Eddy Offermann,
Brett Viren, Masaharu Goto, Olivier Couet, Remi Mommsen, Anna Kreshuk, Ilka
Antcheva, Axel Naumann, Bertrand Bellenot. I am sure I forgot many others.

I am also greatful to Christian Haslinger who suggested in the winter 2006
to convert XPS into a Bioconductor package. Ever since then I am wondering why
I have never considered this obvious step myself before.

During my recent efforts to wrap my C++ library into an R package, I experienced
the continuous help from many R developers. I am especially greatful to Paul
Roebuck for his great example how to call C++ from R, for Benilton Carvalho, 
Seth Falcon, Martin Morgan and especially Herve Pages for their great help to 
understand S4 classes, and Simon Urbanek for his help regarding diverse Intel-Mac 
related problems. Last but not least I want to thank Robert Gentleman for 
reviewing my package and for making helpful suggestions.

Furthermore I want to thank Prof. Brian Ripley (R Core Development), Patrick 
Aboyoun (Bioconductor), Philippe Canal, and especially Bertrand Bellenot for 
their help when porting my package to Windows XP.

I am also greatful to Djork Clevert who provided me the latest implementation 
of the farms package (farms_1.3.1) prior to publication.

Last but not least I want to thank the numerous users for reporting problems,
which helps me to improve the quality and stability of my package.
Especially, I want to thank Annamaria Carissimo for reporting a mas5 problem
with exon arrays, and for continuously testing new updates until I could finally 
solve this problem. Furthermore, I want to thank Simon de Bernard for testing
xps extensively, reporting bugs and even offering solutions, especially an 
essential improvement in class XQuantileNormalizer. 

Jan. 2013:
Although xps, compiled with MS VC++, does work on Windows XP it did not work on 
Vista and Windows 7. For this reason I am very grateful to Alexey Lebedev who 
has adapted the ROOT source package for compilation with MinGW and succceded in 
creating a ROOT binary which finally allows xps to work on Vista and Windows 7,
too.
